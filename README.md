# OUTLINE & PURPOSE:

In this assignment, I have developed a text based version of the game Hangman. Hangman is an old school favorite pencil and paper word game where the goal is simply to find the missing letters of a word. The player is presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find. If the player guesses correctly, then the letters complete the word and they win. However, if an incorrect guess is made, the player loses a life and a part of the hangman is drawn. The object of the game is to guess the word before you either run out of lives or the picture of the hangman is completed.

This program will resemble the game Hangman as an interactive text based version of the word game by using a host to guide the player, a set of clues and colour to distiguish elements of the game.

As Terminal can be very limiting and basic, when used as a means to play a game, I have attempted to make it as entertaining as possible. As with most word games, they can become monotonous, so I have added numerous different words that will be used at random. Having said that, word and number games are designed for a particular type of player and games such as this have an elemnt of longevity due to both their simplicity and difficulty.

Traditionally, a game such as this is played using a pen and paper, but both these items are almost irrelevant in the current world where humans interact and communicate with a device over a pen and paper. Creating an 'app' version points towards an inevitable direction in our evolution as a technologically advanced species.
